# Task Progress and Decisions Log

## Overview
This document tracks the steps taken for tasks in the Litigation Reports system, serving as a decision log and progress tracker for development work.

## Current Session (2025-09-17)

### Task: MCP Server Setup and Documentation
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
**Steps Taken**:
1. Listed available MCP tools and servers
2. Documented Context7, Playwright, Memory Bank, and GitHub server capabilities
3. Confirmed fresh React and Playwright API documentation availability through Context7

### Task: Technology Stack Documentation
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
**Steps Taken**:
1. Used Context7 to retrieve latest React and Playwright documentation
2. Verified API freshness and code snippet availability
3. Created comprehensive Stack.md in memory bank with:
   - React development rules and patterns
   - RTL testing guidelines
   - Playwright integration strategies
   - Development workflow standards

### Task: Progress Tracking System Setup
**Status**: üîÑ In Progress
**Steps Taken**:
1. Created this tasksprogress.md file for tracking decisions and steps
2. Established structure for logging task progress

## Development Workflow Established

### Standard Process
1. **Planning**: Use TodoWrite tool for complex multi-step tasks
2. **Research**: Use Context7 for fresh documentation
3. **Implementation**: Follow React/RTL rules from Stack.md
4. **Testing**: RTL for components, Playwright for E2E
5. **Validation**: Run lint/typecheck before completion
6. **Documentation**: Update memory bank with decisions

### Task Categories
- **Feature Development**: New functionality implementation
- **Bug Fixes**: Issue resolution and debugging
- **Testing**: Test creation and maintenance
- **Documentation**: Knowledge capture and updates
- **Infrastructure**: Setup and configuration changes

## Previous Work Context

### Git Status at Session Start
- Branch: `feature/crud-operations`
- Modified files: `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.mcp.json`
- Recent commits focused on system functionality and UI enhancements

### Key System Components
- Hearing Management System (implemented)
- Frontend Management Pages (implemented)
- Login UI with validation (enhanced)
- CRUD operations (in development)

## Decision Framework

### When to Use TodoWrite
- ‚úÖ Complex multi-step tasks (3+ steps)
- ‚úÖ Non-trivial implementations
- ‚úÖ User requests multiple tasks
- ‚úÖ Tasks requiring systematic tracking
- ‚ùå Single straightforward operations
- ‚ùå Trivial tasks (<3 steps)
- ‚ùå Pure informational requests

### Tool Selection Guidelines
- **Context7**: Fresh documentation lookup
- **Playwright**: Browser automation, E2E testing
- **Memory Bank**: Knowledge persistence, decision tracking
- **GitHub**: Repository operations, PR/issue management

## Future Considerations
- Maintain this log for complex task sequences
- Update Stack.md as new patterns emerge
- Use memory bank for architectural decisions
- Document testing strategies and patterns
