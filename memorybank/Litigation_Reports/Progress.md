- ✅ **Advanced Customizable Reporting System**: Full-featured report builder with filtering
- ✅ **Seamless Authentication Flow**: Session-based + JWT token dual authentication
- ✅ **Production-Ready Deployment**: Built and configured for lit.local:8080

### Advanced Reporting System Implementation

#### Backend API Enhancements
- ✅ **Enhanced ReportController.php**: 8 new endpoints for advanced reporting
  - `/api/reports/dashboard` - Comprehensive dashboard with metrics
  - `/api/reports/custom` - Custom report builder with filtering
  - `/api/reports/templates` - Report template management
  - `/api/reports/export` - Multi-format export (CSV, Excel, PDF)
  - `/api/reports/options` - Dynamic filter and column options

- ✅ **Advanced Filtering System**: Dynamic query building with multiple filter types
  - Date range filtering (from/to dates)
  - Status-based filtering with multiple selections
  - Entity-specific filters (client type, case category, priority)
  - Dynamic column selection and ordering
  - Pagination and sorting capabilities

- ✅ **Report Template System**: Save and reuse custom report configurations
  - Template creation and management
  - User-specific template storage
  - Template sharing and application
  - Configuration serialization

#### Frontend Reporting Interface

  - **Quick Access Cards**: View/Customize buttons for each report type
  - **Report Builder Modal**: Tabbed interface with filters and column selection
  - **Templates Modal**: Template management and application
  - **Detailed Report Modal**: Full-screen report display with export options

- ✅ **Interactive Report Builder**:

  - Column selection with checkbox interface
  - Real-time report generation
  - Export functionality integration

- ✅ **Professional UI Components**:

  - RTL-compliant layout for Arabic interface
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Accessibility features and ARIA labels

### Architectural Transformation: lit.local Only

#### Same-Origin Setup Benefits
- ✅ **No CORS Configuration**: Eliminated cross-origin complexity entirely
- ✅ **Shared Session Context**: Seamless authentication between React and PHP
- ✅ **Simplified Security**: Reduced attack surface with single origin
- ✅ **Performance Optimization**: No preflight requests, shared connection pool

#### Directory Structure
```
backend/
├── public/                 # Web root (Apache DocumentRoot)
│   ├── index.html         # React SPA entry point
│   ├── assets/            # React static assets (CSS, JS)
│   ├── api/               # PHP API endpoints
│   │   └── index.php      # API router with fixed paths
│   └── .htaccess          # Apache routing rules
├── src/                   # PHP backend source
└── config/                # Configuration files
```

#### Apache Routing Configuration
- ✅ **Smart .htaccess Rules**: API routes → PHP, static files → direct, SPA → index.html
- ✅ **Path Resolution**: Fixed PHP include paths for copied API structure
- ✅ **Fallback Handling**: Proper 404 handling and route management

#### Build Integration
- ✅ **Production Build Process**: `npm run build` → `backend/public/`
- ✅ **Asset Optimization**: Vite production build with minification
- ✅ **API Integration**: Copied and path-fixed API structure

### Authentication System Enhancement

#### Dual Authentication Support
```php
// Multi-layer authentication in Auth.php
public static function check() {
    // 1. Check PHP session (web requests)
    if (isset($_SESSION['user_id'])) return true;
    
    // 2. Check JWT token (API requests)  
    $authHeader = $_SERVER['HTTP_AUTHORIZATION'] ?? '';
    if (strpos($authHeader, 'Bearer ') === 0) {
        return self::validateToken(substr($authHeader, 7));
    }
    return false;
}
```

#### Frontend Authentication Integration
- ✅ **Login Flow**: React form → PHP API → Session + JWT token
- ✅ **Token Management**: localStorage storage with automatic refresh
- ✅ **Session Sharing**: Same-origin enables shared authentication context
- ✅ **API Authentication**: Bearer token headers for API requests

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Report Data Structures
```typescript
interface CustomReportConfig {
  entity: 'clients' | 'cases' | 'hearings' | 'invoices' | 'lawyers'
  filters: {
    date_from?: string
    date_to?: string
    status?: string[]
    [key: string]: any
  }
  columns: string[]
  grouping?: string
  sort_by?: string
  sort_order?: 'asc' | 'desc'
}

interface DashboardData {
  total_clients: number
  total_cases: number
  total_hearings: number
  financial_summary: FinancialSummary
  recent_activities: Activity[]
  upcoming_hearings: Hearing[]
  case_statistics: Record<string, number>
  revenue_trend: RevenueData[]
}
```

#### API Service Architecture
