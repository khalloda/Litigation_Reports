## Detailed Bug Reports

### BUG-001: Sass Import Errors Causing White Page
**Date**: December 2024  
**Severity**: High  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed  
**Component**: Sass/SCSS Styling System  

#### **Problem Description:**
The application was showing a white page due to Sass import errors. The main.scss file was using incorrect Bootstrap import paths and the Vite configuration was using deprecated Sass syntax.

#### **Error Messages:**
```
Error: Can't find stylesheet to import.
@import "~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

```
Deprecation Warning [import]: Sass @import rules are deprecated and will be removed in Dart Sass 3.0.0.
```

#### **Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Incorrect Bootstrap Import Path**: The main.scss file was using `@import "~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap"` which is a Webpack-specific syntax not supported by Vite
2. **Mixed Sass Syntax**: The file was using both `@use` and `@import` syntax inconsistently
3. **Vite Configuration Issues**: The vite.config.ts was using modern `@use` syntax in additionalData while main.scss was using `@import`

#### **Files Affected:**
- `src/styles/main.scss`
- `vite.config.ts`

#### **Fix Applied:**

**1. Fixed main.scss imports:**
```scss
// Before (BROKEN)
@use "bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
@use "variables" as *;
@use "mixins" as *;
@use "rtl" as *;

// After (FIXED)
@import "bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
@import "variables";
@import "mixins";
@import "rtl";
```

**2. Updated vite.config.ts:**
```typescript
// Before (BROKEN)
css: {
  preprocessorOptions: {
    scss: {
      api: 'modern-compiler',
      additionalData: `
        @use "@styles/variables" as *;
        @use "@styles/mixins" as *;
      `,
      silenceDeprecations: ['legacy-js-api', 'import', 'global-builtin', 'color-functions']
    }
  }
}

// After (FIXED)
css: {
  preprocessorOptions: {
    scss: {
      additionalData: `
        @import "@styles/variables.scss";
        @import "@styles/mixins.scss";
      `,
      silenceDeprecations: ['legacy-js-api', 'import', 'global-builtin', 'color-functions']
    }
  }
}
```

#### **Verification:**
- ✅ Sass compilation errors resolved
- ✅ Bootstrap styles loading correctly
- ✅ Development server running on localhost:3001
- ✅ RTL styles working properly
- ⚠️ Sass deprecation warnings still present but silenced (non-blocking)

#### **Impact:**
- **Before**: White page due to CSS compilation failure
- **After**: Application loads with proper styling and RTL support

### BUG-002: Duplicate Declaration Error in Users Component
**Date**: December 2024  
**Severity**: High  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed  
**Component**: React/TypeScript  

#### **Problem Description:**
The Users.tsx component had a naming conflict between the imported `Users` icon from lucide-react and the exported `Users` function, causing a duplicate declaration error.

#### **Error Messages:**
```
Pre-transform error: Duplicate declaration "Users"
> 15 | export function Users() {
     |                 ^^^^^

Internal server error: Duplicate declaration "Users"
```

#### **Root Cause Analysis:**
The import statement was importing both a `User` icon (aliased as `UserIcon`) and a `Users` icon, but the component function was also named `Users`, creating a naming conflict in the same scope.

#### **Files Affected:**
- `src/pages/Users.tsx`

#### **Fix Applied:**

**1. Fixed import statement:**
```typescript
// Before (BROKEN)
import { Plus, Edit, Trash2, Eye, Shield, User as UserIcon, Users } from 'lucide-react'

// After (FIXED)
import { Plus, Edit, Trash2, Eye, Shield, User as UserIcon, Users as UsersIcon } from 'lucide-react'
```

**2. Updated icon usage:**
```typescript
// Before (BROKEN)
<Users className="me-2" />

// After (FIXED)
<UsersIcon className="me-2" />
```

#### **Verification:**
- ✅ TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- ✅ Component renders without errors
- ✅ Icon displays correctly in the header
- ✅ No naming conflicts in the component scope

#### **Impact:**
- **Before**: Application crashed with TypeScript compilation error
- **After**: Users page loads and displays correctly with proper icon

### BUG-003: Sass Deprecation Warnings
**Date**: December 2024  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed  
**Component**: Vite Build System  

#### **Problem Description:**
The build process was generating numerous Sass deprecation warnings about `@import` rules, legacy JS API, and global builtin functions. While not blocking functionality, these warnings were cluttering the console output.

#### **Warning Messages:**
```
Deprecation Warning [import]: Sass @import rules are deprecated and will be removed in Dart Sass 3.0.0.
Deprecation Warning [legacy-js-api]: The legacy JS API is deprecated and will be removed in Dart Sass 2.0.0.
Deprecation Warning [global-builtin]: Global built-in functions are deprecated and will be removed in Dart Sass 3.0.0.
Deprecation Warning [color-functions]: red() is deprecated.
```

#### **Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Bootstrap Dependencies**: Bootstrap's Sass files still use deprecated `@import` syntax and global functions
2. **Sass Version**: Using newer Dart Sass version that shows deprecation warnings for older syntax
3. **Build Configuration**: Vite was not configured to silence these specific warnings

#### **Files Affected:**
- `vite.config.ts`

#### **Fix Applied:**

**Added silenceDeprecations configuration:**
```typescript
css: {
  preprocessorOptions: {
    scss: {
      additionalData: `
        @import "@styles/variables.scss";
        @import "@styles/mixins.scss";
      `,
      silenceDeprecations: [
        'legacy-js-api', 
        'import', 
        'global-builtin', 
        'color-functions'
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### **Verification:**
- ✅ Deprecation warnings silenced in console
- ✅ Build process runs without warnings
- ✅ Styles continue to work correctly
- ✅ No impact on functionality

#### **Impact:**
- **Before**: Console cluttered with 200+ deprecation warnings
- **After**: Clean console output with warnings silenced

## Current Known Issues

### Issue-001: Options Endpoints Returning 404
**Severity**: Low  
**Status**: Not Fixed  
**Component**: Backend/API  

#### **Description:**
Some API endpoints for options (dropdown data) are returning 404 errors. This affects the frontend's ability to load dropdown options for forms.

#### **Impact:**
- Dropdown options not loading in forms
- Non-critical functionality affected
- System still fully functional for core operations

#### **Next Steps:**
1. Implement missing options endpoints
2. Add proper error handling for options
3. Test all dropdown functionality

### Issue-002: Partial Data Migration
**Severity**: Medium  
**Status**: Not Fixed  
**Component**: Database/Migration  

#### **Description:**
Only partial data has been migrated from the Access database. Currently only 6 cases, 10 clients, and 1 hearing are loaded, while the full dataset contains 6,388+ cases, 247+ clients, and 20,000+ hearings.

#### **Impact:**
- Limited data available for testing
- Full system capabilities not demonstrated
- Production deployment needs complete data

#### **Next Steps:**
1. Complete full data migration from Access
2. Validate all migrated data
3. Test system with full dataset
